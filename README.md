# indivisible-competitive-equilibrium
Algorithms related to competitive equilibrium in a market of indivisible items.

To verify the non-existence results from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04212),
run the corresponding scripts starting with nonexistence_, for example:

    python3 nonexistence_4goods_3agents.py

The code closely follows the description of the examples in the paper,
but it uses specific numeric budgets. 
By editing the code and re-running, 
you can see to what extent the non-existence is sensitive to changes in the budgets or preferences.
